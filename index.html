    <h2>Demo of Device Information Widget Proposal</h2>
    <div id="container">
      <div id="info" class="border"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="data-change">
      <input type="checkbox" name="minWidth" value="active" /> Minimum width<br />
      <input type="checkbox" name="minHeight" value="active" /> Minimum
      height<br />
      <input type="checkbox" name="border" value="active" checked /> Show
      Border<br />
    </div>
    <p>
      Disclaimer: The blue-ish background is not part of the widget, but it to
      show the container. I made the text changeable inside the value elements
      to allow testing of different lengths of information. I also added some
      styling to match what the help center looks like, but obviously this is
      easily changeable and mainly relies on the API I made. The container is
      also resizeable to allow to view what it would look like at other sizes.
      That feature does not work for Edge or Internet Explorer, but that is
      not important as this is a demo.

      I believe this would be a good addition just because it seems to be a
      common issue where students do not know their browser or even their
      operating system. While it is sometimes easy to figure this out by asking
      something like what does the application icon look like or is there an
      Apple in the upper left-hand corner or four squares in the bottom left
      hand corner it seems that people still get lost and end up just getting
      more frustrated with their issue. Also, it seems that many do not know the
      version of Windows they are using and this can be a hassle to figure out
      what it is. This would be a much speedier way to figure it out. Also, I
      have no clue what browser version I am using and this simply gives it to
      you. Another common issue is people determine the browser Edge and
      Internet Explorer even with a simple probing question like, "Is there a
      yellow halo around the 'e' icon?", the customer ends up getting more
      confused and this wastes extra time. Another thing is screen size, hardly
      anyone knows their screen size, but knowing that is very helpful as it
      makes it possible to further replicate an issue using the Dev Tools to
      makes a screen size similar to the customer. In addition, many people do
      not know their Internet Service Provider and knowing this information is
      helpful to determine outages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please take this proposal in for consideration as it will further improve
      customer service and lead to quicker issue tackling.
